# Python-YoutubeVidDownloader
Main Issues in Code:

Cookie File Dependency: Your code assumes cookies.txt exists, which can cause errors if the file is missing. The cookie file is used for age-restricted or login-required videos.
No Input Validation: The code doesn't validate if URLs are provided or if directories exist.
Limited Error Handling: While you have basic error handling, it could be more informative about specific error types.
Forced Updates: The code automatically updates yt-dlp every time, which might be unnecessary.
No Directory Creation: If the specified download folder doesn't exist, the code will fail.

Key Improvements :
Optional cookie usage: Only uses cookies.txt if it exists
Input validation: Ensures URLs aren't empty and creates directories if needed
Better error messages: Provides specific tips for common errors
Optional updates: Makes yt-dlp updates optional
Graceful interruption handling: Properly handles Ctrl+C
URL validation: Extracts video info first to validate the URL

Common Errors Encounter:
"No such file or directory: 'cookies.txt'" - Fixed by making cookies optional
"Video unavailable" - Usually means private/deleted videos
"Sign in to confirm your age" - Needs cookies.txt from browser
"Requested format not available" - Try different quality settings

Will Fix these Soon....
